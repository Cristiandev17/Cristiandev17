## 🏗 Architectural Approach

When building backend systems, I focus on:

• Clear separation of concerns  
• Testable business logic  
• Scalable API design  
• Infrastructure abstraction  
• Clean dependency management  
• Container-ready deployments  

I prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term solutions.

## 📌 Highlighted Projects

### 🔹 Scalable REST API (Clean Architecture)

Designed and implemented a layered backend architecture using ASP.NET Core.  
Implemented JWT authentication, asynchronous operations, and repository abstraction.  
Optimized performance and improved system maintainability.

---

### 🔹 Data Backend System

Built a backend integrating SQL Server for transactional integrity and MongoDB for flexible document storage.  
Applied repository patterns and abstraction layers to isolate infrastructure dependencies.

---

### 🔹 Enterprise Mobile + API Integration

Developed cross-platform mobile applications connected to secure REST APIs.  
Handled authentication, state management, and backend communication.

## 📈 Engineering Philosophy

> “Architecture should reduce complexity, not introduce it.”

I believe good architecture enables teams to scale, maintain, and evolve systems without friction.
